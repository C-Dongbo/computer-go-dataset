;W[nj]WL[753.115]
;B[po]BL[1316.671]C[Rotfuchs [3k\]: giving up r3 aji
BobWhoosta [1d\]: If black makes many more ko threats in the Q5 area, it will remove R3.

;B[oq]BL[1296.707]C[BobWhoosta [1d\]: M3 was to kill the lower side.
selena [3d\]: b no eye
Rotfuchs [3k\]: maybe didnt read the top correctly
saxo [2d\]: w can't save all
BobWhoosta [1d\]: Easy to see why someone would make that decision.

shredderr [26k?\]: bravo
GarouDan [4k\]: Congratulations
FoxMulder [3d\]: godmoves ke jie?
Nodos [2k\]: ...
Zonked [3d\]: alphago and ke jie are both likely candidates
Onchyru [1d\]: zen sorta got rekt
Nodos [2k\]: or just some anonymous pro
anmollov [6k\]: hwo are you godmoves ???
wurfmaul [2d\]: imagine how disappointed other top pros would be to read something like "are you really ke jie"?
BobWhoosta [1d\]: This wasn't a normal pro.
BobWhoosta [1d\]: This was really high level play.
Crashdown [12k?\]: his client was english
BobWhoosta [1d\]: Black tenukied M3 then came back and lived.
Zonked [3d\]: the time use, really makes me think he could be alphago
Maisha [3k\]: wery high lvl
GoNuts [3k\]: any linux client is english
trust: i go with wurfmaul
BobWhoosta [1d\]: That's not normal.
megaschaf [2k\]: How many points does white have ??
Orc [7k?\]: why can't white O3?
ZeNit [?\]: maybe Zen was just having a bad game
ZeNit [?\]: he needs more coffee
Zonked [3d\]: orc, first of all, b can just live in corner,its enough to win
Zonked [3d\]: but, b can also just answer, since the n4 is in bad shape
Hayosiko [1k\]: this games indeed looked like a fight between two strong bots
Crashdown [12k?\]: too fast to be a bot
lonepeak: zen v 13.1 vs zen v 14.1 xD
Zonked [3d\]: crashdown, not without human operator
ohyou [-\]: how do you distinguish between top pro and freshman?
BobWhoosta [1d\]: Yeah, definitely human.
BobWhoosta [1d\]: Zonked, some of the moves happened instantly.
BobWhoosta [1d\]: Bots have a more measured play.
Zonked [3d\]: yes, try leela bot
Zonked [3d\]: leela has this kind of time management
BobWhoosta [1d\]: Is leela bot strong enough to beat Zen?
Zonked [3d\]: nono, ofcourse not
BobWhoosta [1d\]: So I don't think a bot of this strength would have that type of time management.
Zonked [3d\]: but, just proves you can write good time management for bots
Zonked [3d\]: and why wouldnt alphago have good time management?
BobWhoosta [1d\]: Well, alphago had great time management.
Zonked [3d\]: besides, some of the alphago games being played were with very fast time settings
BobWhoosta [1d\]: But never played a move instantly.
BobWhoosta [1d\]: I can agree it's possible, but I think this was a human.
Zonked [3d\]: anyways, until proven otherwise, b is alphago in my books
BobWhoosta [1d\]: AlphaTroll...
Crashdown [12k?\]: we'll never know
Zonked [3d\]: alphago likes this opening too btw
Hayosiko [1k\]: 4 first black moves are the same as in alpha vs alpha game 1
Zonked [3d\]: lol, played yose out, where black sacrifices bottom
Zonked [3d\]: black wins by half a point
Zonked [3d\]: tho my yose isnt nearly good enough to be certain, there is a reasnable chance b could have won even if bottom group dies
Zonked [3d\]: anyways, tagged this game as zen 13.1 vs AlphaGo :)
Naphthalin [?\]: b feels extremely powerful here o.O
